The National Trails System Act created a program for long-distance natural trails on October 2, 1968, establishing the first two of eleven national scenic trails: the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. The first four of nineteen national historic trails were established by Congress in 1978, marking the routes of early travels across the country. Over 1,300 national recreation trails have since been administratively designated. (map pictured). (Full list...)

Julie d'Aubigny
Julie d'Aubigny (1673–1707), better known as Mademoiselle Maupin or La Maupin, was a 17th-century French opera singer. Her life inspired numerous fictional and semi-fictional portrayals. Théophile Gautier loosely based the title character, Madeleine de Maupin, of his novel Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835) on her.
